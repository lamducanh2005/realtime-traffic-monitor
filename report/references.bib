abstract = { To solve the problem of the storage of massive traffic video data and real-time traffic flow monitoring, using the big data processing platform Spark to analyze and research massive traffic videos, the traffic flow monitoring scheme based on Spark traffic video data is designed to conduct real-time traffic video analysis. Parallel computing of processing data is realized through Spark Core, and the YOLOv5s target detection model is applied to the vehicle detection of the system. The real-time and Robustness are verified through an experiment on BrnoCompSpeed Dataset. The research results provide that the performance of the cheap machine cluster system using the distributed computing framework is found to be more effictive than the single-machine-based data analysis system, it can meet the real-time performance well, moreover.the system cost is lower than traditional single-machine large-scale server. },
